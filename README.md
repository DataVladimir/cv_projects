Google Sheets project:
Formalized tasks:
1. Calculate the weekly customer retention rates by cohorts.
2. Calculate unit economics metrics for each cohort.
3. Determine whether advertising expenses are being recouped.
4. Identify the most effective promotion sources.
5. Determine the cities where the company generates the highest profits.


Tasks for the project were performed using Google Sheets along with the following tools, methods, and techniques:
1. Data Analysis: Various data analysis techniques were employed to analyze the company's data and extract meaningful insights. This involved using statistical methods, such as regression analysis, to understand the relationships between variables and identify trends.
2. Cohort Analysis: Cohort analysis was conducted to examine the behavior and performance of different customer cohorts over time. This involved grouping customers based on their acquisition or conversion dates and analyzing their subsequent actions and outcomes.
3. Unit Economics Calculation: The calculation of unit economics metrics, such as customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and customer churn rate, was performed. This helped evaluate the financial viability and profitability of the business.
4. Advertising Cost Analysis: The effectiveness of advertising campaigns and the return on investment (ROI) from advertising expenses were assessed. This involved tracking advertising costs, measuring campaign performance, and analyzing key metrics like cost per acquisition (CPA) and conversion rates.
5. Performance Measurement: Key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined and monitored to assess the success of various marketing and sales efforts. These KPIs could include metrics like revenue growth, customer acquisition rate, customer retention rate, and customer satisfaction.
6. Visualization: Data visualization techniques were utilized to present findings and insights in a clear and concise manner. This involved creating charts, graphs, and dashboards in Google Sheets to facilitate data interpretation and communication.
7. Geographic Analysis: Geographic analysis was performed to identify regions or cities where the company generated the highest profits. This could involve mapping and analyzing sales data by location to understand regional performance and inform business expansion strategies.

In summary, the project utilized Google Sheets as the primary tool for data analysis and employed various methods, such as cohort analysis, unit economics calculation, advertising cost analysis, performance measurement, visualization, and geographic analysis, to gain insights and make informed decisions.


SQL + PowerBI project:
Formalized tasks:
	1. Evaluate the sales dynamics and revenue distribution by products.
	2. Create a customer profile by determining which customers generate the highest revenue.
	3. Monitor the company's logistics (determine if all orders are delivered on time and identify the best state to open an offline store).
To accomplish these tasks, I utilized the following tools, data, and methods:
Data Analysis: PostgreSQL was employed to manage and analyze the company's actual data. Querying the database and performing data manipulations provided insights into various aspects of the business.
Statistical Methods: Statistical techniques and methodologies were applied to analyze sales dynamics and revenue distribution. Descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing were utilized to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
PowerBI: PowerBI, a powerful data visualization tool, was utilized to create interactive dashboards and reports. By connecting to the data sources, visual representations of key metrics and performance indicators were generated, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the company's sales and revenue patterns.
By employing these tools, leveraging data, and applying statistical methods, meaningful insights were derived, and data-driven decisions were made for the company.
